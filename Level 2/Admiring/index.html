        <h2>Admirable Qualities</h2>
        <p>Ah, let me tell you about the legendary Baba Ji! Imagine a wizard in the land of databases, who magically transforms confused souls like us into SQL sorcerers. It's like he's teaching us the art of taming wild data beasts, and we're there scratching our heads, wondering if we accidentally wandered into a dragon-training class.

Baba Ji's teaching style is like a secret recipe guarded by a clan of quirky pandas. He drops these pearls of wisdom that, at first, sound like cryptic riddles from a wise old owl. We're left blinking, trying to figure out if we've just been handed the key to unraveling the universe or if we missed a punchline somewhere.

Picture this: we walk into his class with the courage of a knight, armed with a pen and notebook as our sword and shield. But before we know it, Baba Ji has us tangled in a web of JOINs and normalization, and we're desperately praying that our armor of basic knowledge doesn't shatter into pieces.

Oh, and the exams! It's like Baba Ji has a pact with the exam gods, granting him the power to create questions that make us question our life choices. We leave the exam room feeling like we've just emerged from a battlefield, except the battlefield was a SQL query gone rogue.

But here's the kicker: when the results roll in, it's like the punchline to a cosmic joke. We're staring at our grades with eyes wide open, thinking, "Wait, did Baba Ji just pull a Gandalf and guide us through Moria, and we came out with flying colors?"

In the end, Baba Ji's class isn't just about databases; it's a rollercoaster of emotions, a journey where we discover that maybe, just maybe, we're not as clueless as we thought. So here's to you, Baba Ji, the data whisperer, the query conjurer, and the reason we can now proudly say, "Fear not, for SQL is with us!"</p>
